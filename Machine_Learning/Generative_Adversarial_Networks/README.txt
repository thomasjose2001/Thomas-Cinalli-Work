Here is a piece of machine learning code of mine. I programmed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. By training the GAN on this dataset, the generator learned to produce images resembling various types of fashion items, allowing for visual analysis of how well the model could replicate the patterns and features found in the original dataset.
